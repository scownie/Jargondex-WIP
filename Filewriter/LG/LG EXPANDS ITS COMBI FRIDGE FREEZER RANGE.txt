Press Release 03/21/2014 LG EXPANDS ITS COMBI FRIDGE FREEZER RANGE LG launches four impressive new models ready for the UK’s most popular home renovation weekend of the year UK, London, March 2014 – LG Electronics (LG) today announces the launch of four new combination fridge freezers. The unveiling comes ahead of the May Day Bank Holiday, proven to be one of the most popular weekends of the year for Brits to complete DIY projects and improvements around the home. In fact, research shows that 45 per cent of British homeowners will spend the extra day working on their homes, making LG’s launch very timely for those looking for more than just a spring clean this May Day. The modern, sleek and contemporary style of LG’s latest refrigeration models - available in Premium Steel and Platinum Silver - offers a fresh look to any kitchen in need of a lift. For those looking to create more open plan living in their home, the stand-out design of the new combi fridge freezers can even deliver a confident style statement and focal point in a social space. Whether a living space is big or small, LG recognises the growing demand for space saving solutions. LG’s latest fridge freezer range offers consumers maximum flexibility in the home, with all models providing impressive capacity – ranging between 314 – 339 litres (net) – whilst sitting within a neat 60cm wide footprint. Three of the new products include optional water dispensers and none require plumbing, meaning that consumers are unrestricted when it comes to installation and placement within the home. The new product range also features Zero Clearance design, allowing installation close to corners and other work surfaces as well as making access to food in drawer compartments easier. The full range of new combi fridge freezers boasts features to help keep produce at its freshest. These includ Total No Frost, that ensures freshness, cleanliness, faster cooling and energy saving; and a Multi Air Flow system, that sees cool air circulated through multiple vents, ensuring efficient cooling at an even temperature throughout. Also included is LG’s Express Freezing technology, which locks in freshness and nutrients by freezing food quickly. All of the four new products incorporate LG Smart Diagnosis Technology™ that enables the appliances to self-diagnose technical issues and communicate them to a server, to encrypt the code. This Smart technology simply requires the user to hold a telephone handset against the appliance whilst pushing a button situated on the refrigeration control panel. A three second noise will be emitted to LG’s server over the phone, which can translate over 90 different soundwaves into a diagnosis, thus ensuring no unnecessary tampering or engineer visits, saving time and money. At the top of the latest range is the GBF530PVQPB, the most premium product of the collection that offers a higher energy efficiency rating of A++. Additional features incorporated in the product include the Moist Balance CrisperTM, a lattice-type box cover that improves moisture retention, helping boost the longevity of food items; and the Fresh 0 Zone that allows consumers to think ahead, with the ability to store fish and meats at 0°C prior to cooking - a great feature when juggling tasks or wanting to leave marinated foods to develop flavour. Dawn Stockell, Head of Brand Marketing at LG Electronics, comments: “Thanks to LG’s innovative technologies the average life span of home appliance products is growing. We are seeing consumers increasingly looking at purchases of home appliances as a longer term investment and therefore spending more time researching products before they commit. We know that the nation is hooked on DIY over the May Bank Holiday so when better to choose new home appliances that work with the space available and deliver features that truly benefit our individual lifestyles? “This latest range from LG offers a powerful combination of performance, convenience and energy efficiency through cutting-edge technologies - helping to reduce food waste and improve people’s lives.” For more information about this product please contact the LG-One press office lgukpress@lg-one.com # # #   LG GBF530PVQPB, A++ Energy Rated Platinum Silver Combi Fridge Freezer with Water Dispenser    Energy grade A++    Water Dispenser with no plumbing required    Dimension (mm) 595 x 2010 x 686    339 net capacity    Total No Frost    Fresh 0 Zone    Moist Balance Crisper™    Multi Air Flow    Express Freezing    Zero Clearance    LED Light    External LED Display    Smart Diagnosis™    Door alarm    Child lock    10-year Warranty (on its Compressor)    SRP £699.99 LG GBF539NSQWB, A+ Energy Rated Premium Steel Combi Fridge Freezer with Water Dispenser    Premium Steel    Energy grade A+    Water Dispenser with no plumbing required    Dimension (mm) 595 x 1900 x 686    314 net capacity    Total No Frost    Multi Air Flow    Express Freezing    Zero Clearance    LED Light    External LED Display    Smart Diagnosis™    Door alarm    Child lock    10-year Warranty (on its Compressor)    SRP £679.00 LG GBF539PVQWB, A+ Energy Rated Platinum Silver Combi Fridge Freezer with Water Dispenser    Platinum Silver    Energy grade A+    Water Dispenser with no plumbing required    Dimension (mm) 595 x 1900 x 686    314 net capacity    Total No Frost    Multi Air Flow    Express Freezing    Zero Clearance    LED Light    External LED Display    Smart Diagnosis™    Door alarm    Child lock    10-year Warranty (on its Compressor)    SRP £629.99   LG GBB539PVQWB, A+ Energy Rated  Platinum Silver Combi Fridge Freezer    Platinum Silver    Energy grade A+    Dimension (mm) 595 x 1900 x 686    318 net capacity    Total No Frost    Multi Air Flow    Express Freezing    Zero Clearance    LED Light    External LED Display    Smart Diagnosis™    10-year Warranty (on its Compressor)    Door alarm    Child lock    SRP £599.99   Media Contact: LG-OneUK Alison Metcalfe +44 (0)20 7413 3060 lgukpress@lg-one.com   About LG Electronics, Inc.
