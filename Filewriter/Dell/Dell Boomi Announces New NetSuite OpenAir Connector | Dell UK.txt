Email RSS Feed Date : 14/05/2014 Round Rock, Texas New Solution is Available for Data Exchange in the Cloud with NetSuite OpenAir Dell Software announced today that Dell Boomi, a leader in enterprise Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS), has released a new NetSuite (NYSE:N) OpenAir connector, designed to allow the movement of data into and out of NetSuite OpenAir professional services automation (PSA) software. The Dell Boomi AtomSphere® NetSuite OpenAir connector enables NetSuite OpenAir customers to integrate any combination of on-premises and cloud applications with NetSuite OpenAir and includes a prebuilt connector for Salesforce.com. By integrating NetSuite OpenAir with other applications across an organization, including very large enterprise systems like SAP and Oracle in a two-tier model, business processes can run automatically. For instance, a company may need to track the sale, progress and billing of a service engagement across CRM, PSA and ERP applications; Dell Boomi AtomSphere integrates these applications to automate this process. The results include greater efficiencies, a reduction in errors and improved visibility into all aspects of a customer engagement. The Dell Boomi AtomSphere simplifies enterprise connectivity with NetSuite OpenAir, the industry’s leading cloud-based PSA solution for project management, resource optimization, time and expense, and project accounting that enables organizations to streamline the entire services lifecycle from bid to bill, gaining agility and scalability for rapid growth. NetSuite OpenAir is used by more than half of the 13 services organizations identified as “Best of the Best” in a 2014 study of 238 firms by Service Performance Insight, the leading services industry research consultancy. SPI’s study found that “Best of the Best” leaders net 209 percent greater profits, 132 percent higher per-project revenue and 57 percent greater annual revenue per employee than other firms.[1] Services teams at large global companies such as Siemens and Software AG use NetSuite OpenAir to increase efficiency and results, integrating the PSA solution with a corporate SAP ERP installation in place at each company. “Standardized connectors like this new NetSuite OpenAir connector enable Dell Boomi and NetSuite customers to speed the process of integrating cloud applications, and optimizing business processes to increase an organization’s time to value. Dell Boomi AtomSphere iPaaS is capable of automating a variety of business processes across NetSuite OpenAir and any combination of other business-critical applications,” said Chris McNabb, general manager, Dell Boomi. “NetSuite’s partnership with Dell Boomi continues to deliver value to NetSuite customers by extending the NetSuite platform and enabling bi-directional data exchanges to and from our platform.
