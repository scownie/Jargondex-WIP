Symantec Reports Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Results Non-GAAP operating margin and EPS exceed guidance; revenue in-line with expectations Results fueled by strength in enterprise backup, enterprise endpoint protection and DLP On track to achieve our fiscal year revenue and operating margin targets at original guided exchange rate MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. – November 5, 2014 – Symantec Corp. (Nasdaq: SYMC) today reported the results of its second quarter of fiscal year 2015, ended October 3, 2014. Michael A. Brown, president and CEO, said, “Symantec delivered solid results this quarter that demonstrate the underlying strengths of our security and information management businesses. We are pleased with the growth we achieved in enterprise endpoint security and data loss prevention. Strong performance in our NetBackup appliances accelerated from 35% year-over-year growth in the June quarter to 45% in the September quarter.” “Symantec operates the largest civilian threat intelligence network in the world, which is a competitive advantage that makes our products and services increasingly capable of defending against sophisticated threats,” Brown said. “In October, we released an upgrade to our flagship enterprise security product, Symantec Endpoint Protection, which improves our ability to stop targeted attacks, and we launched our Managed Adversary Threat Intelligence offering that provides enterprise customers with greater threat intelligence as to who is attacking them.” Thomas Seifert, executive vice president and CFO, said, “We are successfully executing against the priorities we outlined at the beginning of the year, and in particular our eight revenue and efficiency initiatives are contributing to revenue and margin expansion. Achieving nearly 29% non-GAAP operating margin this quarter, a 120 basis point improvement year-on-year, underscores our ability to improve profitability. We are on track to achieve our fiscal year revenue and operating margin targets at our original guided exchange rate.” Last month, Symantec announced plans to separate into two publicly traded companies, one focused on security, the other on information management. “We believe this separation will provide each business the flexibility and focus to drive growth and enhance shareholder value,” Seifert said. “To minimize disruption for our customers and partners, we have dedicated teams managing the separation process and our go-to-market capabilities will remain largely intact for the remainder of this fiscal year.” Results for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2015 (Dollars in millions, except EPS)   2Q15 2Q14 Reported Y/Y Change GAAP Revenue $1,617 $1,637 (1%) Operating Margin 21.5% 15.1% 640 bps Net Income $244 $241 (1%) Deferred Revenue $3,417 $3,567 (4%) EPS (Diluted) $0.35 $0.34 3% CFFO $173 $191 9% Non-GAAP Operating Margin 28.7% 27.5% 120 bps Net Income $332 $359 (8%) EPS (Diluted) $0.48 $0.51 (6%) Third Quarter and Fiscal Year 2015 Guidance (Dollars in millions, except EPS)   3Q15 FY15   At Expected FX Rate At Previous FX Rate At Expected FX Rate At Previous FX Rate GAAP Revenue $1,650 - $1,690 $1,695 - $1,735 $6,600 - $6,680 $6,715 - $6,795 Operating Margin 19.2% - 20.2% 20.7% - 21.7% 19.4% - 19.8% 20.3% - 20.6% EPS (Diluted) $0.31 - $0.34 $0.33 - $0.36 $1.31 - $1.36 $1.37 - $1.42 Non-GAAP Operating Margin 28.3% - 29.3% 29.5% - 30.5% 27.4% - 27.8% 28.3% - 28.6% EPS (Diluted) $0.47 - $0.50 $0.49 - $0.52 $1.88 - $1.93 $1.94 - $1.99 Tax Rate 27% 27% 26% 26% Share Count 697 million 697 million 697 million 697 million FX Rate (€/$) $1.27 $1.38 $1.31 $1.38 Symantec's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per common share to be paid on December 17, 2014 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 24, 2014.
