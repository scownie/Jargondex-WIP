What is RSS? RSS is an acronym for "Rich Site Summary" and "Really Simple Syndication." RSS helps you easily keep track of additions to Symantec news, and any other site or news feed on the Internet that supports RSS. What does it do? Finding it hard to stay abreast of the latest news and content on the Web? Youâ€™re not alone. The number of sites and people producing content has increased to an unmanageable size. Repeatedly checking each website for content updates can be very tedious. Email notification of changes was an early solution to this problem. Unfortunately, when you receive email notifications from multiple websites they are usually disorganized and can get overwhelming, and are often mistaken for spam. RSS is a better way to be notified of new and changed content. Notifications of changes to multiple websites are handled easily, and the results are presented to you well organized and distinct from email. Subscribe to Press Releases
