Featuring 4K Photo Mode Panasonic announces the new firmware update program for the LUMIX DMC-FZ1000. The firmware will be released to enhance the performance and controllability of the camera, featuring new 4K Photo Mode. The 4K Photo is a new way of photography that Panasonic proposes. It encourages users to capture spur-of-the-moment in high resolution 4K photo by cropping out a designated frame out of the 4K video. With the new firmware, it is easier to get 4K photo by using the 4K Photo Mode. Once selecting the 4K Photo Mode, recording format / picture quality setting / brightness level are automatically set to the optimum parameter for photo shooting. Users can record high quality video either in 4:3, 3:2 or even 1:1 aspect in addition to 16:9 – all can provide a still image with 8-megapixel equivalent resolution. Each JPEG image cropped out of the video footage complies with EXIF just as a normal still picture. While recording the 4K video in 4K Photo Mode, it is possible to mark the designated part by just pressing the [Fn1] button. This can reduce postproduction work for searching the spur-of-the-moment worth cropping out. There are more functional upgrades such as an addition of 4K video recording in 23.98p (MP4, AAC) and 3 new additional option for shutter sound. The PHOTOfunSTUDIO 9.5PE and Panasonic Image App for iOS/Android will also be updated to support these functional upgrades.  The new firmware program is scheduled to be released at the Panasonic LUMIX Support Site at http://panasonic.jp/support/global/cs/dsc/ in the beginning of October, 2014. -ENDS- •Android and Google Play are trademarks or registered trademarks of Google Inc. • IOS is a trademark or registered trademark of Cisco in the U.S. and other countries and is used under license.
