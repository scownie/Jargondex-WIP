Simon Parkinson, Panasonic UK’s Marketing Director, is used to tackling a mountain of emails and meetings but this week has swapped his suit for climbing gear as he climbs Kilimanjaro in aid of Macmillan. While Simon has been battling the cold temperatures, fatigue and altitude sickness, his Lumix TZ60 is also working hard to deliver breath-taking pictures documenting his climb. This photo was taken 17000ft up the mountain from his camp site. Simon is carrying with him a 35 litre day pack, solar panels to power his electronics and a 90 litre duffel bag. On top of his essential gear and the DMC-TZ60, he chose to take with him the HX-A500 wearable 4K headcam and the 7in rugged Toughbook tablet, with a 3G card for internet access to document the experience. His climb is expected to take roughly 8 days in total, to reach the mountain’s peak of just under 19,500ft.
