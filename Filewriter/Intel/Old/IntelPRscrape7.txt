In collaboration with FutureEverything and Smart Citizen, Intel Collaborative Research Institute (ICRI) for Sustainable Connected Cities will aid in the deployment of 30 sensors in the Manchester area, announced today at the FutureEverything Festival.  The devices take measurements of environmental variables including temperature, CO2, noise, light, humidity and Wi-Fi saturation.  Five will be more intelligent ‘super sensors,’ based on the Intel Galileo board, and will serve as reference points for the roll out, the first Smart Citizen deployment in the UK.  Following the festival, workshops will be held for developers to build applications off the open data collected, to work towards a smarter future for our towns and cities.
