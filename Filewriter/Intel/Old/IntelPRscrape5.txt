Yesterday, the Intel IT department in Swindon joined 24 students from four local schools to code, test, and race cars built using the Intel® Galileo board. Students, aged 13-15, successfully developed a remote control vehicle to race against each other.  Grouped into teams of four, pairs developed apps on Intel based tablets or programmed the Intel Galileo board on Ultrabook™ devices to understand the basics of coding. Using that foundation, the teams developed a program to control the car via a tablet, enabling all six vehicles to successfully complete a predetermined circuit. To further the students’ interests in programming, each school left Intel with two Intel Galileo boards. If you are a University and you would like to apply for the Intel® Galileo University Donation Program, please apply here (eligibility criteria and terms and conditions apply).   Intel IT programming 1.jpg 16.8 MB Intel IT programming 2.jpg 14.5 MB Intel IT programming 3.jpg 14.7 MB Intel IT programming 4.jpg 8.6 MB Intel IT programming 5.jpg 10.1 MB
