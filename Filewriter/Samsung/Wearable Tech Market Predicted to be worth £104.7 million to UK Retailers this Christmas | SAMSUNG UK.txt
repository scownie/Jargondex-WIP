The UK is also the country with the highest growth in unit sales of wearables across Europe, at 120.8%, followed closely by Germany (118.2%) and Spain (117.2%). Andy Griffiths, President of Samsung UK & Ireland, comments: “The wearables market has exploded over the past 12 to 18 months with some incredibly exciting and innovative products entering the market. As the benefits wearable technology can offer become better understood, it is natural that the sales within this sector will grow and we are delighted to see predictions of 121% growth and sales reaching €395 million in the UK alone by the end of this year. At Samsung, we are passionate about bringing to market products that enhance peoples' lives and hope that as we continue to innovate in the exciting wearables space that our products will continue to excite and engage people.” William Kim, AllSaints CEO, comments: “Wearables have a key part to play in the future of fashion retail and this research today from Samsung underlines their potential to totally reinvent the sector. The last decade has seen an evolution in verbal and written communication - today I have five ways I can instantly speak with anyone in the business whether in our atelier, our distribution centres or our global stores. The next decade will see an evolution of non-verbal communication - wearables and the internet of things will communicate information at a rate never before seen allowing businesses to be more efficient and enabling greater emphasis on the customer experience. For AllSaints this is the truly exciting part.” For further information visit: www.samsung.com/uk/ Notes to Editors: 1.
